# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 12
### What have I learnt this week?
This final week’s class was cancelled. We all know that we need to get the group many-model assignment completed and submitted by our new due date of November 6th. I cannot believe term just flew by, but as always, time does have a way of moving on. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know a lot of things that I didn’t know before I began this subject. Through reflecting on what I learnt throughout this whole term, I know that each and all of us are modellers in our own ways, we just need to harness it further to become better decision-makers.  I also learnt that without models, making sense of data is difficult. Data contributes to society by helping its people describe reality, even though it does so imperfectly. However, even whilst alone, data can’t decide between 2 decisions.  Though single models can do well, the many models work a lot better. That is why the best of thinkers, the most accurate predictors, and the most effective design teams utilise many models. Scott E. Page refers to them as, *'many-model thinkers'*.

A model symbolises a domain or process, often using variables and mathematical formula. (In practice, many people create numerous informal models in their head, or in writing, but it is actually getting into the heart of officialising your models, that makes it more helpful towards their clarification and usefulness.)  Models have capabilities that humans lack. Models can capture and obtain more data. They can be tested, and have comparisons performed upon them. And models don’t do logical errors. They also don’t suffer from any cognitive biases. (They can, however, reinforce the biases that humans have; which therefore necessitates many models.)

Models make you want to be logical in your findings. They force you to be forthright in terms of driving people’s behaviours or firms’ behaviours — how do those behaviours work with the other, how do they aggregate, and then what do people have to do about it? The world is an insanely complex place, it always has been, and it always will be. The challenge is to become a more nimble thinker, and enable flexible movement across these models. However, simultaneously if you cannot find within yourself to be able to do that, that doesn’t mean there’s no place for you in this world. To be frank, it means that you need to be more in depth of the inner workings of the models-as I found out for myself. 

In Charlie Munger’s words: *‘To understand the world around you, you’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience - both vicarious and direct - on this latticework of models’*.

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this entire subject is that  while applying one model is good, using many models — called an ensemble — is much better, especially in complex problem situations. Models are made to simplify. So, no matter the data quantity a model gets there will always be missing pieces of the puzzle. Therefore, any model can be incorrect. With many models, you can make up for these missing puzzle pieces. However, it should be known that to design great many models, it does very much require thought and effort. Model building helps you become more detail oriented and will inspire you to learn more about the history of the things that you’re working on. Overall, models, like humans, make a lot of mistakes because they fail to take into account, the relevant variables or interactions. Many-model thinking overcomes the focus failures of any single model. It enhances one’s wisdom this way.

In saying that though, I myself am not going to create world peace. I am not going to solve climate issues. My brain isn’t that big to tackle these issues head on. However, even though we experience too many events larger than ourselves, we can have different models, thereby creating a larger collection of models actually have great chances of addressing and combating these issues. But we can’t all just venture out there and do well, we can’t simply take this knowledge and newly acquired wisdom, with us and go make the world a better place. That is not until we’ve gotten useful tool sets, not only individually, but we need to ensure that they’re collectively useful as well. No one changes the world alone and no one doesn't change it at all. We are all exceptional and none of us are. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
For me, my perceived strengths have been that I now recognise and see why models matter in society, and that I can now understand people and myself a bit better than ever before. That being said, my weaknesses are that I still have a long way to go in improving my programming skills by a long shot, and also I do need to start further developing my numerical, logical, natural, and spatial thinking to understand things more in depth. 

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Me and my team are steadily working through our final group assessment, and implementing the feedback we got from Juan. We’ll cross the challenges bridge when we come to it. We can handle the challenges by asking each other and Juan for help when needed before the due date. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to keep on learning, and keep on experimenting with various types of models in any given situation. I will signal to others and see how they signal as well. I will improve my learning styles and skills in my quest of lifelong learning. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
There were no new theories to learn this week. However, I will always keep in mind the theories I have found useful throughout most of this term.
